# Connect Four
This project is an implementation of Connect Four. This implementation allows 2 players to play in the Linux command line. The purpose of this project is to learn the basics of functional programming and OCaml.

One thing I was practicing in this project was using OCaml lists. In the future, I may come back and change the code to use arrays instead as that would be more efficient.

The command line UI was inspired by [mg2239 and adelinewang679's implementation of Connect Four](https://github.com/mg2239/connect-4).
